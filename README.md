# Cyberpunk 2077 code matrix solver

This project can help people solve the hacking minigame in Cyberpunk 2077.

## [Manual Solver](https://yukiiro-nite.github.io/cyberpunk-code-matrix-solver/manual-solver.html)
You can fill in the code matix and sequences and solve for what ever buffer size you have. For some buffer sizes there are not solutions, so you may have to try fewer / shorter sequences.

## [Automatic Solver](https://yukiiro-nite.github.io/cyberpunk-code-matrix-solver/auto-solver.html)
The automatic solver will allow you to point your phone camera at the screen, and the code matrix and sequences will be read from the picture. The solution will be overlayed on the image.

The automatic solver is still a work in progress.
